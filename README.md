# Image Processing Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a range of image processing techniques using Python and OpenCV (`cv2`). It consists of two main parts, each handling different images and applying various filters and algorithms.

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Super Mario Image Processing

**- `part-1-ex1.py`** - Applied two filters:
  - **Median Filter**: To reduce noise.
  - **Basic Smoothing Filter**: To blur the image slightly.

**- `part-1-ex3.py`** – Applied a patch-based algorithm to recover a missing portion of the image.


### Part 2: Unique Image Processing and Analysis
**- `part-2.py`** – Performed the following:
  1. **Grayscale Conversion**: Analyzed the image in grayscale.
  2. **RGB Histograms**: Generated histograms for color distribution.
  3. **Gradients and Intensity Analysis**: Examined the image structure.
  4. Applied three image processing actions: **Geometric Transformation (Rotation)**, **Central Crop**, and **Sharpening Filter**.

## How to Run

To reproduce the project, clone the repository and run each of the Python files separately.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python
- **Library**: OpenCV (`cv2`)
